In R1: The default value of me:TInfinity was used.
In R1: No tunneling method was found for R1
In R1: Not a unimolecular reaction: look for excess reactant concentration.
In R2: Parsing reaction...
In TS_1a: No vibrational frequencies were assigned for OCHCH2, assuming it to be a sink term.
The default value of me:frequenciesScaleFactor was used.
In R2: No imaginary vibrational frequency. Check if there is tunneling.
No tunneling method was found for R2
All molecules are on the same energy basis: arbitary
The default value of me:precision was used.
