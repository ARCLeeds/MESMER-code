In R1: Parsing reaction...
In Methyl: The default value of me:frequenciesScaleFactor was used.
In Methyl: Methyl:ZPE was given a range with 3 steps 
In H: The default value of me:symmetryNumber was used.
In H: The default value of me:frequenciesScaleFactor was used.
In H: The default value of spinMultiplicity (or one of its attributes) was used.
In H: The default value of me:DOSCMethod was used.
In Methane: The default value of me:frequenciesScaleFactor was used.
In Methane: The default value of me:DistributionCalcMethod was used.
In Methane: The default value of me:energyTransferModel was used.
In Methane: Methane:deltaEDown was given a range with 15 steps 
In Methane: The default value of me:deltaEDownTExponent was used.
In TS1: Cannot find argument me:vibFreqs. Assumes that it is an atom or atomic ion.
In TS1: No rotational constants from <me:rotConsts> or structure. Assumed to be an atom or atomic ion.
In TS1: The default value of me:frequenciesScaleFactor was used.
In TS1: The default value of me:DOSCMethod was used.
In TS1: No value of me:ZPE was supplied and the default value NEEDS TO BE CHECKED**
In TS1: TS1:ZPE will be derived from Methyl:ZPE. Check below that this has been found.
In R1: No imaginary vibrational frequency. Check if there is tunneling.
No tunneling method requested for R1
In R1: No crossing method requested for R1
In R1: Not a unimolecular reaction: look for excess reactant concentration.
In R1: No value of me:excessReactantConc was supplied and the default value NEEDS TO BE CHECKED**
All molecules are on the same energy basis: arbitary
