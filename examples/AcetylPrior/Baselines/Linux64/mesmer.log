adding reaction terms to the collision matrix 
In AceticAcid: No value of me:ZPE was supplied and the default value NEEDS TO BE CHECKED**
In mesmer::CollisionOperator::timeEvolution: m_ZPE was not defined but requested in AceticAcid. Default value 0 is given.
In FastLaplaceConvolution: 20 values in the FFT convolution routine were replaced by standard convolution
