WARNING: Chemically significant eigenvalues (CSE) not well separated from internal energy relaxation eigenvals (IEREs).

The last CSE = -1.69072e+08 and the first IERE = -9.40611e+08
(last CSE)/(first IERE) ratio = 0.179747, which is less than an order of magnitude

Results obtained from Bartis Widom eigenvalue-vector analysis may be unreliable
