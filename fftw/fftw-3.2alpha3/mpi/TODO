Finish the documentation.

More performance benchmarking & optimization, especially on the Cray
(and other large machines).

Test program should also check SCRAMBLED_IN/SCRAMBLED_OUT 1d case.

rank==1 r2c/c2r? This is tricky, but should be doable with a scrambled
transpose mode.

Multi-dimensional block distributions.  (From a performance
perspective, 1d block distributions seem theoretically superior when
they are possible, but the problem is that they limit the
parallelization to the size of the largest dimension.  This is
especially problematic for high-dimensional transforms.)
