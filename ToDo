  * Provide users a plugin class to calculate all DOS.

A thought on calculating the density of states from ILT of the product of partition functions of two rotors (namely,
the DOS of the reactants). May well this function should like MicroRateCalculator having an individual class for other uses? e.g. Cross
usage of different methods.

  * Get general form of functions to calculate density of states of reactant(s) and product(s), also
    provide a plugin method to allow users to specify the way of counting rovibrational density of
    states of molecules.

  * Modify dMatrix to template (several functions have to be rewritten to template as well!?)

  * Set upper limit of EGME to 99%? of the energy under Boltzmann distribution
    of the largest complex or the upper limit defined previously (whichever higher).
  * parallel computation treatment of the matrix diagonalisation processes --
    degradation of matrices.
  * update the precision of varaibles -- the double-double (dd) and quad-double (qd)
    operations are time consuming processes; therefore, it is better to allow user
    choosing precision on runtime, i.e. not on the compilation time.
