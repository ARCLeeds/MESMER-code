  _2007_11_13__17_00_33_ CHL Modify Reaction to include SuperMolecule

  * Add the source term?

_2007_11_02__15_11_43_ Chi-Hsiu Liang

  * Provide users a plugin class to calculate all DOS.

_2007_09_19__09_38_18_ Chi-Hsiu Liang

  * Set upper limit of EGME to 99%? of the energy under Boltzmann distribution
    of the largest complex or the upper limit defined previously (whichever higher).
  * parallel computation treatment of the matrix diagonalisation processes --
    degradation of matrices.
  * update the precision of varaibles -- the double-double (dd) and quad-double (qd)
    operations are time consuming processes; therefore, it is better to allow user
    choosing precision on runtime, i.e. not on the compilation time.
