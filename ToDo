  * Modify dMatrix to template (several functions have to be rewritten to template as well!?)

  * Set upper limit of EGME to 99%? of the energy under Boltzmann distribution 
    of the largest complex or the upper limit defined previously (whichever higher).
  * parallel computation treatment of the matrix diagonalisation processes -- 
    degradation of matrices.
  * update the precision of varaibles -- the double-double (dd) and quad-double (qd)
    operations are time consuming processes; therefore, it is better to allow user
    choosing precision on runtime, i.e. not on the compilation time.
