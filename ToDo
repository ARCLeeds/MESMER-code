  * Set upper limit of EGME to 99%? of the energy under Boltzmann distribution
    of the largest complex or the upper limit defined previously (whichever higher).
  * parallel computation treatment of the matrix diagonalisation processes --
    degradation of matrices.
  * update the precision of varaibles -- the double-double (dd) and quad-double (qd)
    operations are time consuming processes; therefore, it is better to allow user
    choosing precision on runtime, i.e. not on the compilation time.

  * Added a plug-in class for calculating distribution. This plug-in can be used to produce either cell or grain 
    distribution fractions. Please check for calculateDistributionFractions()
    -- This function will be responsible for the distribution of a species. In case not a Boltzmann distribution, an additional 
       plug-in class will be required.
  * isomers and sources are now member varaibles of ReactionManager. They are cleared every time when the system collision operator
    is built.
  * Add a function for time evolution calculation, which generates time-dependent species profiles. (not complete)
  * Added a variable m_population in all CollidingMolecule and SinkMolecule.
  * Force 1st member of SuperMolecule be CollidingMolecule. Need to think about how to treat association of identical molecules.
  * Added a class a2d_t for making dynamic two-dimensional matrix.
  * Need to adjust cellEne for offset.
