	diagram  and collapsable data sections.
	
2007-07-28  Chris Morley
	
	* src/MicroRate.cpp, .h, src/SimpleILTx.cpp, src/SimpleRRKMx.cpp:
	Mod of MicroRateCalulator classes to be plugin classes and to keep 
	all their data in the Reaction class.
	
	* src/Molecule.h, .cpp: Remove diagCollisionOperator which is also
	in ReactionManager
	
	* Persistence.h, XMLPersist.h,.cpp:Add ReadBoolean() and WriteAttribute
	methods. Activate Read() and modify WriteMainElement(). More flexibilty
	found to be necessary.
	
	* src.System.h,.cpp:Add ReadRange() method and use it for T, P and conc.
	Not yet used properly in calculation.

2007-07-21  Struan Robertson

        * src/MicroRateCalculator.cpp/.h: Separated micro-rate calcuator base
        class into separate file and added test method to this class.

        * src/SimpleILT.cpp/.h: Added implementation of simple dissociation ILT 
        method.

2007-07-09  Struan Robertson

        * src/Reaction.cpp/.h: Separated micro-rate calcuation code into
        calculator classes.

        * src/SimpleRRKM.cpp/.h and SimpleILT.ccp/.h calculator classes added to
        calculate micro. rate coeffs. via RKKM and ILT respectively.

2007-06-12  Struan Robertson

        * src/Reaction.cpp/.h: Isomer reaction terms reviewed and simplified,
        unnecessary methods and variables removed.

	* src/ReactionManager.cpp/.h: Altered so that it no longer uses the
        ReactionConnectivety class.

        * src/MoleculeManager.cpp/.h: Accessor methods added to locate the bath
        gas molecule. This is required in the calculation of bath collision
        frequencies. Knock on changes required to Molecule.cpp/.h and System.cpp/
        .h

	I/O rewritten to improve code isolation and allow TinyXML
	to be replaced if necessary. See description in Persistence.h
	
	* src/XMLPersist.h, src/XMLPersist.cpp added.
	* src/Persistence.cpp removed
	* src/util.cpp added. Contains formatFloat(), now a global
	function.

	* src/Persistence.h, (IPersistObject rename to IPersist)
	and most other files.
	
2007-01-18  Chris Morley
	
	* src/Persistence.h, Persistence.cpp: Added output utility
	functions WriteElement(), WriteMainElement() and 
	WriteValueElement(). In IPersistObject at present, but maybe
	they should be elswhere.

	object address in XML document.

	* src/Molecule.cpp(testDensityOfStates): Output also to XML

	instuction to be passed on. See:
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1618031&group_id=13559&atid=313559

	* src/main.cpp: Can specify output file with default of adding
	out before extension on inputfile name. Added usage function and some exit codes.
