	* in Molecule.cpp, function void CollidingMolecule::collisionOperator(double beta):
			vector<double> work only needs to have size GetSys()->MAXGrn()
	* Question: 
			In Molecule.cpp, line 388, double ei = log(m_gdos[i]) - beta*m_egrn[i] + 10.0; why adding 10.0
			if the 10.0 power of ten will be cancelled in line 397:         (*m_egme)[j][i] *= (work[i]/work[j]);
			Any special meaning?
	* Removed duplicated files MicroRateCalculator.cpp & .h
